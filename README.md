# Form - o - Express.js 

An attempt to learn and getting acquainted with Node.js and its shenanigans :relaxed:
This is a simple form based web server application.

## Getting Started

Install the Node Package Manager 
```bash
$ sudo snap install node --classic --channel=10
$ npm install nodemon -g
```

Fork this repo and clone it
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<Your User Name>/simple-form-expressjs.git
```

Open the folder and install the dependencies
```bash
$ npm install express
$ npm install pug
```

Run the application
```bash
$ nodemon index.js
```

The server runs at port 80 i.e. http://localhost:3000/

## Next Step
Open localhost:80 in your browser.
